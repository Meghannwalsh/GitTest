# git workflow 
 
# make new repoo in github
# link repo to code 
# add collaborator 
# collaborator accepts request and clones the code - do not fork

# only one person works oon the master at a given time
# when that persons turn is up they:
# git add . 
# git coommit -m "these are the changes that were made"
# git push 

# the other person then pulls down the coode with "git pull" 
# that workflow continues
